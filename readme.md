# WAFOM-WAFOM

## Basic

* Dimension over R = 16
* Dimension over F2 = 16
* Number of precision digits = 32

## Point set generation

* Basis for 10000 digital nets are randomly selected.

## WAFOMs

* WAFOM values W_c(P) for c = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 are calculated.
* W_c'(P) is plotted against W_c(P).

## Files

* If the first/second digit of the name of a file is i, the c-value and c'-value for WAFOM is i-2.
